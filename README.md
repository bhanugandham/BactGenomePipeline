# **BactGenomePipeline: Bacterial Genome Annotation Pipeline**

**BactGenomePipeline** is a streamlined Snakemake pipeline designed to annotate bacterial genomes starting from raw FASTQ reads. The pipeline uses popular bioinformatics tools like **Flye**, **Prokka**, **NanoPlot**, **Porechop**, **Filtlong**, and others to QC, assemble, and annotate bacterial genomes.

---

## **Overview**

This pipeline automates the process of:
1. **Quality Control and Preprocessing**: From raw FASTQ files to filtered reads.
2. **Genome Assembly**: Using the Flye assembler for nanopore sequencing data.
3. **Genome Annotation**: Annotating the assembled genome with Prokka.

**Outputs**: The pipeline generates an annotated genome in **GBK** and **GFF** formats.

## **Installation**

To set up and run this pipeline, follow these steps:

### **1. Clone the Repository**

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:bhanugandham/BactGenomePipeline.git
cd BactGenomePipeline
```

### **2. Install Snakemake**

Ensure that Snakemake is installed:
```bash
conda create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake -y
conda activate snakemake
```

### **3. Create the Conda Environments**

The pipeline uses multiple Conda environments for different steps. You can create and activate them using the following command:
```bash
snakemake --use-conda --conda-create-envs-only
```
Snakemake will automatically create the required environments and install all dependencies as specified in the `environment` folder.

### **4. Install Conda Dependencies (if necessary)**

If you need to install individual Conda environments for preprocessing, assembly, and annotation, use the following commands:
- **Preprocessing**:
```bash
conda env create -f environment/preprocessing.yaml
```
- **Assembly**:
```bash
conda env create -f environment/assembly.yaml
```
- **Annotation**:
```bash
conda env create -f environment/annotation.yaml
```

## **Input Files**

The pipeline expects the following input:
- **FASTQ** file: Raw nanopore sequencing data (e.g., `SRR30810013.fastq.gz`).

### Note:
The `data/` folder in this repo contains only an empty/placeholder file. To successfully run the pipeline:

1. Add the FASTQ files (compressed in `.fastq.gz` format) to the `data/` folder.
2. Update the `config.yaml` file to include the respective sample prefix under the `samples` field.
3. Run the pipeline as described in the [Running the Pipeline](#running-the-pipeline) section.

Once the pipeline completes, the results will be generated in the `results/` folder. Ensure that the sample prefixes in `config.yaml` match the names of the input files in the `data/` folder.

---

## **Pipeline Overview**

The pipeline processes the data in a series of steps:

### **1. Quality Control and Preprocessing**
- **NanoPlot**: Generates quality statistics and plots for the raw reads.
- **Porechop**: Removes adapter sequences from the raw reads.
- **Filtlong**: Filters the reads based on mean quality score and length.

### **2. Genome Assembly**

- **Flye**: Assembles the genome using nanopore raw reads. This step requires a sample file for the genome size and target genome.

### **3. Genome Annotation**

- **Prokka** : Annotates the assembled genome using a prokaryotic genome database and standard annotation parameters.

---

## **Configuration**
The pipeline is configured using the `config.yaml` file. Below is an example configuration:

```bash
samples:
  - SRR30810013
```
The `samples` field defines the list of sample identifiers (usually the name of the input FASTQ file without the extension).

---

## **Running the Pipeline**
To run the pipeline, execute the following command from the project directory:

```bash
snakemake --use-conda --cores 16 --jobs 16 --scheduler greedy -p --rerun-incomplete
```
### **Options** 

- `--use-code` : Uses conda environments specified in the Snakefile.
- `--cores` : Allocates 16 CPU cores for execution. Adjust according to your available hardware.
- `--jobs 16`: Specifies that 16 jobs can be run in parallel.
- `--scheduler greedy`: Uses the "greedy" scheduler, which resolves jobs in a more flexible manner and can help avoid certain issues during scheduling.
- `-p`: Prints the commands as they are executed.

This command will process the input data, perform the necessary preprocessing, assembly, and annotation, and store the results in the `results/` directory. Additionally, this configuration ensures that the pipeline runs efficiently while utilizing available resources.

---

## **Output**

After running the pipeline, the following outputs will be generated:
- **Genome Assembly**:
  - `results/SRR30810013/assembly/polished_1.fasta`: The final polished genome assembly.
- **Genome Annotation**:
  - `results/SRR30810013/annotation/annotated.gbk`: GenBank format annotated genome.
  - `results/SRR30810013/annotation/annotated.gff`: GFF format annotated genome.
- **Reports**:
  - `results/SRR30810013/raw_statreports`: NanoPlot quality reports for raw reads.
  - `results/SRR30810013/filtered_statreports`: NanoPlot quality reports for filtered reads.
